# UniversityLabs
It is just a project that contains mostly my labs from the university

For now it contains some topics on Number Methods especilly solving the systems of linear equations, integrals and so on. OOP is also present
The code are not especially good, but you may want to use some of them, for example algorithms. 
Hope you'll find it useful
